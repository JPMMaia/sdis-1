# Distributed Systems 1 - Backup Service

This project was developed for the [Distributed Systems](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=350471) course of [MIEIC](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/CUR_GERAL.CUR_VIEW?pv_curso_id=742&pv_ano_lectivo=2016) @ [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.Inicial). This project consists in a distributed backup service for a local area network (LAN). The unsused space of the computers in a LAN is used to backup files in other computers in the same LAN. The service is provided by servers, one per computer, that retain control over their own disks and, if needed, may reclaim the space available for backing up other computers' files.
